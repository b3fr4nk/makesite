Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire? Uh, Doc. Erased from existence.

Yeah okay. He's a peeping tom. Dad. See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all.

Perfect, just perfect. Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. No. Right about here. Uh, I think so.

Excuse me. Hi. Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium. You broke it. Wow, look at him go. Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me.
